<strong>CASTIGLIONCELLO (LI) Toscana</strong><br><br>
<p>Castiglioncello is an ancient Etruscan village and a renown tourist destination of great international fame.
It is called "the pearl of the Tyrrhenian Sea" because of its unique charm.  It has always been enclosed in the nature of a protected area, which has contributed to its elegance and purity over the years.  It is surrounded by luxuriant pine forests, spectacular cliffs, sheltered bays and beaches that are washed by the clear waters that characterize this part of the coast.</p>
<p>This location has ancient origins.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Brief historical background: </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Already in the second half of the 800\'s, the art critic and patron, Diego Martelli, built his home here. His home is now better known as the Castello Pasquini.  It his here that he hosted the famous Macchiaioli group of painters (with Abbati, Fattori, Borrani, Cabianca, etc...) who started the "School of Castiglioncello". To this day, the Castello Pasquini is the center of many cultural activities; from dance to theater.  It hosts of the traditional Festival of Dance and holds the award ceremony for the "Literary Prize of Castiglioncello\'s Coast of the Etruscans". We also must not forget that this little town was made famous thanks to artists such as Gassman, Mastroianni, Sordi and others who enjoyed staying here.  In fact, it was the cinematographic setting chosen to make the famous movie "The Easy Life", in which Vittorio Gassman starred. The Medici Tower is also noteworthy.  It was built in the middle of the sixteenth century to defend the town from the Saracen pirates who threatened the Tyrrhenian sea. Finally, this historical overview would not be complete if we did not suggest a visit to the National Archeological Museum, which is especially renown for the numerous Etruscan tombs that were discovered in the area.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Castiglioncello is, in many ways, one of the most inviting settings.  An ideal location for summer holidays.</strong></p>
<p>It is located in the heart of Tuscany, on the border of the Ligurian and Tyrrhenian Sea.  It has a luxuriant vegetation.  Its pines and oaks provide its coast with shade and its coastline is filled with tourists who are in search of relaxation and a mild climate. The Marradi Pine Forest is situated on the seaside.  Here, the air is filled with iodine and wood essences.  It feels like an inviting place where one can take relaxing walks; several children areas are found in this forest and so is the famous open-air movie theater, which is open during the summer months.  In the summer, a small market also settles in this pine forest on every Thursday of the week.</p>

</div>


<p >On the central Plaza, or Piazza della Vittoria, there are a series of classy stores where one can even shop at night and the different historical bars, which surround the plaza, are filled with people during the aperitif hours. The Quercetano Bay is an attractive cove.  In fact, it was a source of inspiration for Gabriele D\'Annunzio. This welcoming atmosphere, of ancient origin, offers many different accommodation opportunities, as numerous restaurants offer quality recipes thanks the the freshness of the fish, which is caught on a daily basis.</p><br>

<p >There is a seaside path, called the Lungomare Colombo, where one can take walks and over a stretch of about 4 kilometers.  On this path, one can walk along the various creeks, which follow each other, and breath the sea air.  The path starts in Punta Righini, which is one of the most wild and rocky settings of the coastal area and continues to the marina of Cala dÃ¨ Medici. There are 650 berths (10% of which are reserved for transit), a shipyard and a yacht club in this harbor.  There is also a big parking lot and a shopping area. Those who arrive at the marina of Cala dÃ¨ Medici contribute in their own way to the mosaic scenery of boats, faces and languages that animate this lively and vital area throughout the year. The Rotta del Vino, the gourmet race of the Etruscan Coast, is one the most important fests for which this Harbor is renown.  This fest is held during the second week of September and the boats race against each other at sea while chefs are busy making dishes, which are judged by a super-specialized jury on the basis of their originality and wine combination, on board! One can practice all of the various water sports, such as sea-watching, diving, fishing, sailing and windsurf in some of our facilities. The Yacht Club of Castiglioncello is also noteworthy.  It was established in 1946.  Here, people of all ages can take sailing lessons or rent sail boats and motorboats to explore the wonders of the coast. The most famous summer festival, the Fish Fest, is held in June at the Caletta Bay.</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>Castiglioncello has a pleasantly dry climate that could make anyone fall in love: many sunny days throughout the year and always mild temperatures are the secret to a perfect holiday. Here, the average temperature for the month of January, which is the coldest month of the year, ranges from a minimum of 10Â°C to a maximum of 20Â°C.  In August, however, it ranges from a minimum of 23Â°C to a maximum of 32Â°C. Although it generally almost never rains, most of the rainfalls occur between the months of October and December.  Nonetheless, the climate stays mild and is always recommended for those who suffer from respiratory diseases.

define('CONTENUTOINTORNO','

<br>

<p><strong>Bolgheri (30 Km)</strong>: a typical medieval village developed around a castle and famous for its long Cypress path, which was praised by the poet, Carducci. This place is renown for its magnificent environmental setting and for its fine red wines. The Sassicaia, the native Sangiovese and the numerous wines of the Ornellaia estate, as well as those of the Guado Tasso estate, are ranked among the most renown wines of the area. Bolgheri is, thus, an internationally renown culinary destination; many events are organized in this town, but we would like to mention the Bolgheri Melody fest and the <A HREF="http://www.eventiesagre.it/Eventi_Enogastronomici/2287_Bolgheri+jazz.html" target="_blank">Bolgheri Jazz</A> fest, which are respectively held in July and September, and where many of the most well-known wine producers of the area open their cellars to the public for wine tasting events that are combined to the pleasures of food, music and art.  The towns of Castagneto Carducci, Casale Marittima, Bibbona, Montescudaio, Guardistallo and many other fascinating towns of Tuscany are located but a few kilometers away.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p><strong>Rosignano Marittimo and the White Beaches</strong> (2 Km): the part of the coast between Rosignano and Vada is very Caribbean-like: the White Beaches and white colored sand appear reminiscent of a Polynesian atoll.<br><br>




Ample parking and equipped beaches, as well as large public beaches for tourists.</p><br>
  
  
<p><strong>Volterra (50 Km)</strong>: has characteristically become a typical medieval city where one can still enjoy the atmosphere of an ancient village since it is completely isolated from industrial and commercial development. Volterra is entirely surrounded by a thirteenth-century wall and has a perfectly well-preserved medieval center where the famous Piazza dei Priori, the Roman Theater of Vallebuona and the Etruscan Museum can be found.  The Etruscan Museum is a must see attraction for all tourist and a great source of pride for this ancient Etruscan. Volterra is a little place in Tuscany where there many events are organized, especially in the summertime; from lyrical music to jazz, from theater to medieval re-enactments in enchanted locations that are filled with history and charm.</p><br><br>




<p><img src="http://agenziaradar.it/images/80_5_fotoImmobile 2.jpg" width="424" height="282" hspace="4" align="left" title="residence posti barca il Romito Livorno foto by Luca Caponi"  /><strong>Baratti and Populonia ( 65 Km):</strong> Baratti is a unique natural harbor where all of the beauty of the sea, the beaches and the picturesque archeological ruins of the ancient Etruscan necropolis are harmoniously blended together. A scenic road runs along the beach of the Gulf. The sand is thick enough and has a special silver-blue reflection. A winding road connects Baratti to the ancient fortified village of Populonia, which dominates the Gulf. Populonia is a unique seaside Etruscan city.  It was originally built to favor the processing of iron that came from the Elba Island.</p>




<br><br>
<p><strong>The thermal town of Venturina - the Calidario lake (53 Km):</strong> Venturina is immersed in the green vegetation of a beautiful pine forest and Calidario is a small lake with hot springs of water at 36 degrees, which flow directly into a tub; an embracing spring from which one can enjoy the benefits of water and steam baths. These springs were already renown during the Etruscan and Roman period.  They offer visitors a warm embrace of natural well-being..</p>

<br><br>



<p><strong>Pisa (48 Km):</strong> is a city of ancient origins.  In fact, it was built by an Etruscan settlement, which later became a Roman colony whose influence can still be seen in the architectural designs of the religious and civil buildings, of the narrow alleys and of the city squares. The city, through which passes the Arno river, reached its zenith in the eleventh century, when it was an important naval base and because of the trade market it established throughout the Mediterranean territory. Its most important monuments are undoubtedly the Leaning Tower and the Cathedral.  However, the Church of Santa Maria della Spina and the ancient Church of S. Paolo a Ripa d\'Arno, which is a classical example of Romanesque architecture,  are also worth visiting.</p>


<br><br>

<p><strong>Florence ( 128 Km): </strong>The Arno river also passes through Florence.  This city is surrounded by olives and vines.  It is undoubtedly the most renown and captivating city of Tuscany. 
Florence was founded by the Romans in the first century BC.  In the fifteenth century, period during which it reached its zenith, the city was dominated by the Medici family. Since then, the most famous artists such as Giotto, Cimabue, Michelangelo, Brunelleschi and Botticelli have left an unforgettable imprint, which can still be admired thanks to their paintings, sculptures and impressive works of art such as the Cathedral, the Palazzo Vecchio and others. The most renown museums of Florence are the Uffizi Gallery, the Accademia Gallery, the Medici Chapels and the National Museum of Bargello. </p>
<br><br>



<p><strong>Siena (180 Km): </strong>is an ancient Etruscan city that is situated right in the middle of Tuscany.  This city reached its zenith in the Middle Ages. We can still admire the ancient walls and structure of the medieval village, which is made up of narrow alleys and noble palaces. The Cathedral, which dates back to the fourteenth century, the Piazza del Campo - where the Palio of Siena takes place - and the surrounding buildings as well as 15 museums, including the Palace and Civic Museum, the National Art Gallery and the Tablet Museum, are of definite artistic interest. <br><br>
<strong>Lucca (70 Km): </strong>is one of the few Tuscan cities that managed to preserve its walls, which were built between 1504 and 1645 and which were never used for defense. It became famous in the fifteenth century for its silk art, which was its primary source of income. Today, one can admire the Palazzo della Signoria, the Church of Santi Giovanni and Reparata and the San Martino plazza where the Cathedral, which was dedicated to San Martino, is located.  In fact, the Cathedral is the most important religious building of the city.</p>
<br><br>

<p><strong>San Gimignano (116 Km):</strong> is famous on an international level for its 14 towers.  San Gimignano is located in the heart of the Tuscan country fields, between Florence and Siena and at 334 meters above sea level on a hill that dominates the Elsa Valley.</p>


<br><br>


<p><strong>The Islands of the Tuscan Archipelago:</strong> it is said that when the Venus of the Tyrrhenian Sea emerged from the waters of our sea to embrace the horizon, she lost seven pearls from the necklace that adorned her white neck.  These pearls fell into the water and transformed themselves into the Islands of the Tuscan Archipelago.
